Based on the diagnostic results in the image, it looks like your issue is indeed proxy-related. Let's test this out by modifying your original script to implement the recommended solution.

Here's an updated version of your script that explicitly disables proxies:

```python
import requests

def check_internet_connection():
    try:
        # Define empty proxies dict to explicitly disable any system proxies
        proxies = {'http': None, 'https': None}
        
        # Test connection to a reliable website with proxies disabled
        print("Attempting to connect to Google...")
        response = requests.get("https://www.google.com", proxies=proxies, timeout=5)
        print(f"Response status code: {response.status_code}")
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            print("✅ Internet connection is active.")
            return True
        else:
            print(f"⚠ Internet connection test failed with status code: {response.status_code}")
            return False
    except requests.ConnectionError as e:
        print(f"❌ No internet connection. Error: {e}")
        return False
    except requests.Timeout:
        print("❌ Internet connection timed out.")
        return False

def check_web_scraping_capability():
    try:
        # Define empty proxies dict to explicitly disable any system proxies
        proxies = {'http': None, 'https': None}
        
        # Test scraping capability by accessing a public website
        url = "https://httpbin.org/get"  # A public API for testing HTTP requests
        
        # Same user agent as in your original code
        headers = {
            'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (XHTML, like Gecko)'
        }
        
        # Add proxies parameter to disable system proxies
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, proxies=proxies, timeout=5)
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            print("✅ Web scraping is possible.")
            print("Response preview:", response.json())
            return True
        else:
            print(f"⚠ Web scraping test failed with status code: {response.status_code}")
            return False
    except requests.ConnectionError:
        print("❌ Unable to connect to the test website.")
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Checking internet connection...")
    internet_working = check_internet_connection()
    
    if internet_working:
        print("\nChecking web scraping capability...")
        scraping_working = check_web_scraping_capability()
        
        if scraping_working:
            print("\n✅ Success! Your Python script can now access the internet and perform web scraping.")
            print("The issue was resolved by explicitly disabling proxies in your requests.")
        else:
            print("\n❌ Your script can connect to the internet but still has issues with web scraping.")
            print("Try different URLs or check if there are other security restrictions.")
    else:
        print("\n❌ Still having internet connection issues.")
        print("You might need to check your TLS version or firewall settings.")
```

This modified script:

1. Explicitly disables proxies using `proxies = {'http': None, 'https': None}`
2. Applies this to both your internet connection test and web scraping test
3. Keeps the same user agent you had in your original code
4. Provides clear feedback about what's working or not

Run this script to see if it resolves your connection issues. If this works, you'll need to add the proxy configuration to all your web scraping scripts moving forward.

If you're still having issues after trying this solution, the diagnostic output also mentions two other potential causes:
1. TLS version incompatibility 
2. Firewall/Antivirus blocking Python connections

Would you like me to provide solutions for those issues as well if the proxy fix doesn't work?
