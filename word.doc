| **1. Investment Objective**                       | The fundâ€™s objective is to generate returns primarily through investment in bonds, with flexibility across credit quality, regions, and currencies. It can invest up to **50% in below-investment grade bonds** and also in other securities, money market instruments, and derivatives for investment efficiency. |        |
| **2. Permitted Investments**                      | Major allocation is to **bonds (including below investment grade, convertible, contingent convertible bonds)**. It may also invest in other asset classes, regions, investment funds, warrants, and money market instruments.                                                                                      |        |
| **3. Restricted Investments**                     | It does **not directly invest in certain activities/industries/issuers** above limits defined under sustainability-related disclosure rules. Restrictions also apply on excessive exposure to contingent convertibles beyond set thresholds.                                                                       |        |
| **4. Benchmark**                                  | No target benchmark. Performance is compared against a **composite index**: 50% Markit iBoxx Asian Local Currency Index + 50% JP Morgan Asian Credit Index. Used only for comparison, not as an investment constraint.                                                                                             |        |
| **5. Maximum Derivative Leverage Limit & Method** | Uses **Absolute VaR** method under UCITS rules. Expected leverage: **250% of net assets**. Global exposure is monitored through VaR; derivatives may increase leverage but the fund is not classed as a leveraged financial instrument.                                                                            |        |
